It is a basic convolutional neural network (CNN) model to differentiate between cat and dog images trained on datasets by Kaggle. A sequential model is created with convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers. The final layers consist of densely connected layers with a binary classification output. The model is then compiled with appropriate optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metric. After compilation, the model is trained using model.fit() function. We specify the number of epochs and steps per epoch. And at last, the trained model is evaluated on the testing images to check its performance.
